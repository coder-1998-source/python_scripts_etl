Got it 👍 — here are some clean and user-friendly message examples for all three cases — **success**, **no data**, and **failed** upload — that you can use in your Django or JavaScript UI.

---

### ✅ **1. Data Uploaded Successfully**

Use when your upload and processing finish without issues:

```text
✅ Data uploaded successfully!
```

or

```text
🎉 Upload complete — your data has been saved successfully.
```

or

```text
✔️ Your file was uploaded and processed successfully.
```

---

### ⚠️ **2. No Data to Upload**

Use when the system detects that there’s no new or valid data:

```text
⚠️ No data available to upload.
```

or

```text
ℹ️ Nothing to upload — no new records found.
```

---

### ❌ **3. Data Upload Failed**

Use when an exception or validation error occurs:

```text
❌ Upload failed — please try again.
```

or

```text
🚫 Something went wrong while uploading your data.
```

or

```text
⚠️ Upload failed due to an unexpected error. Please check your file and try again.
```

### 💡 **Tip for Django (example)**

In your view:

```python
if success:
    message = "✅ Data uploaded successfully!"
elif no_data:
    message = "⚠️ No data available to upload."
else:
    message = "❌ Upload failed — please try again."
return render(request, 'yourpage.html', {'message': message})
```

In your HTML:

```html
{% if message %}
<div class="upload-message">{{ message }}</div>
{% endif %}
```

And you can style it with CSS:

```css
.upload-message {
  font-size: 14px;
  font-weight: 500;
  margin-top: 10px;
}
```

Would you like me to give you styled versions (green for success, orange for no data, red for failed) that show as popup or alert messages in your page?
