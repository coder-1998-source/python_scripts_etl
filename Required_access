Ah, this specific message tells us exactly the issue:

> **"No reply address is registered for the application"**

This happens when you use **Interactive login / device login / auth code flow**, but your Azure AD app has **no Redirect URI configured**.

Since you're running your code locally (not hosted yet), you must add a **Redirect URI**.

---

### ✅ **Fix: Add Redirect URI in Azure App Registration**

1. Go to **Azure Portal → App registrations**
2. Select your app
3. Go to **Authentication**
4. Under **Redirect URIs**, click **Add a platform**
5. Choose:

   ✅ **Mobile & Desktop applications** *(for device/MSAL desktop flow)*
   OR
   ✅ **Web** *(if using auth code flow)*

---

### 📍 **For local development, add these Redirect URIs**

#### **MSAL Desktop / Device Code Flow**

Add this URI:

```
https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/nativeclient
```

If using `acquire_token_interactive()`, also add:

```
http://localhost
```

and/or

```
http://localhost:8000
```

*(depending on your local app port)*

---

### ⚙️ **Example MSAL setup that requires this**

```python
result = app.acquire_token_interactive(scopes=["Mail.Send"])
```

This interactive flow **must have Redirect URI registered**.

---

### 🧠 Why This Error Occurs

When MSAL tries to open the browser login, Microsoft needs a callback URL to return the auth code.
Since you registered the app without a redirect URL → Microsoft doesn't know where to send the token → **error**.

---

### ✅ After you add the redirect URI, retry login.

---

### 🌟 **Important note for your case**

Since you're **not an Azure admin** and probably developing/testing:

* Use **Delegated permissions**
* Redirect URI only for **interactive authentication**
* You DON'T need a hosted website yet

### Should I give you a step-by-step screenshot guide?

Tell me your app type so I tailor instructions:
📌 Python
📌 Django
📌 Node.js
📌 React
📌 .NET
📌 Other

And also confirm: are you using

1. ✅ **Personal Outlook account**
2. 🏢 **Office/Company account**

Your next step depends on this.
